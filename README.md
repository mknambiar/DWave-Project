Problem 1 (the only one for now)
----------------------------------
Matching problem. In a square there are n red and n blue points. We connect one red and one blue point by an interval, the weight of this connection (matching) is the distance between them. The aim is to match any red point with blue one such that a total weight of matching should be minimal.

Files are jupyter notebooks

There is a variable n in the program which indicates the which is the number of pairs of red and blue pairs. This is to be changes for solving problems of various sizes
